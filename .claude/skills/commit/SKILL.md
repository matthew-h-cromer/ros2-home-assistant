# Commit Changes

Create commits following the Conventional Commits specification.

## Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

## Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, no code change
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, auxiliary tools, libraries

## Rules
1. Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 50 chars
2. Body: explain *why* not *what* (the diff shows what)
3. Wrap body at 72 characters
4. Reference issues when relevant: "Fixes #123"
5. Do NOT add "Generated by Claude", co-author lines, or any AI attribution

## Process
1. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` to understand changes
2. If nothing staged, stage relevant files with `git add`
3. Determine appropriate type and scope from the changes
4. Write commit message following the format
5. Execute the commit

## Examples
```
feat(speech): add wake word detection node

Enable voice activation with configurable wake phrase.
Defaults to "Hey Ross" for the ROS2 pun.
```

```
fix(audio): handle missing microphone gracefully

Previously crashed when USB mic disconnected. Now logs
error and waits for device reconnection.
```

```
chore: update dependencies for Python 3.12

Faster-whisper 1.0 requires updated numpy. Also
pins silero-vad to stable version.
```
